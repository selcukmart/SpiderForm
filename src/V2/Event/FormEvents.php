/**
 * Form Events - Constants for form lifecycle events
 *
 * These events allow you to hook into the form lifecycle and modify
 * form data, add validation, or perform other actions at specific points.
 *
 * Event Order:
 * 1. PRE_SET_DATA - Before data is set to the form
 * 2. POST_SET_DATA - After data is set to the form
 * 3. PRE_SUBMIT - Before submitted data is processed
 * 4. SUBMIT - During form submission
 * 5. POST_SUBMIT - After form submission
 * 6. PRE_BUILD - Before form HTML is built
 * 7. POST_BUILD - After form HTML is built
 *
 * Example:
 * ```php
 * $builder->addEventListener(FormEvents::PRE_SET_DATA, function(FormEvent $event) {
 *     $data = $event->getData();
 *     // Modify data before it's set to form
 *     $event->setData($modifiedData);
 * });
 * ```
